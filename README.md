# NavMesh & Pathfinder from scratch in Unreal Engine 5.3

## Summary

In this small project, I created a simple NavMesh generator and pathfinder from scratch without using any third-party software or plugins. The generated path is then followed by an agent.

This is a small portfolio piece that aims to demonstrate AI navigation understanding and the implementation of some complex algorithms.

## Try it yourself

Guide:

1. Clone the project.
2. Open the uproject file using Unreal 5.3 and let it compile. 
3. Once compiled, open "Level_1" or "Level_2.
4. Set the view to “Top” orthographic perspective.
5. Set the rendering to "unlit".
6. Play in Editor using the “Simulate” option.
7. Once playing, use the on-screen UI to progress the NavMesh creation. Once the NavMesh steps are finished, the pathfinding steps can be done.
