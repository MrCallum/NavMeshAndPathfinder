# NavMesh & Pathfinder from scratch in Unreal Engine 5.3

## Summary

In this small project, I created a simple NavMesh generator and pathfinder from scratch without using any third-party software or plugins. The generated path is then followed by an agent.

This is a small portfolio piece that aims to demonstrate AI navigation understanding and the implementation of some complex algorithms.

## Try it yourself

Guide:

- Use Unreal 5.3.
- Set the view to “Top” orthographic perspective.
- Play this in Editor using the “Simulate” option.
- Once playing, use the on-screen UI to progress the NavMesh creation. Once the NavMesh steps are finished, the pathfinding steps can be done.
